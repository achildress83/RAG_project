# RAG_project

I built a RAG pipeline to query and summarize arXiv research papers.

- RAG_playground.ipynb is the dev notebook that contains detailed comments and thoughts on preprocessing.

- arXiv_query_UI.ipynb is the final app with UI. 

- utils.py is the python file containing all classes. Its methods are used in the previous two notebooks. It’s heavily commented, so hopefully easy to follow.
